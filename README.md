Meet the workfellows:

This project is about a shopping mall or a shopping mart in which we have:
* An administrator:
  * Who can __Add__ the products
  * Who can __Modify__  the products
  * And, who can __Delete__  the products
* A Buyer:
  * Who can __select__ products from the list

This program will then generate a receipt, which will contains:
* _Product No._
* _Product Name_
* *Quantity*
* *Price*
* *Amount*
* *Discount*
* *Total*
